# React Native

React Native is based on React components. We can modularize our project into separate modules. Here all components are separate modules with JS, CSS and HTML everything embedded in single component.

React native converts JavaScript (React) code into Native code.
- bridges native and JS development
- expose native modules to JS
- cross platform
- brings some of the good parts of the web to mobile
